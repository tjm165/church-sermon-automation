# Church Sermon Automation
At my church, we record two sermons every Sunday for our YouTube channel. One in English and one in Arabic. I recognized that parts of the editing process are __**very**__ tedious and have potential to be automated. Hence, this project serves to automate part of the editing process. I was excited apply the programming knowledge that I had developed over the past few years to something that would help people.
